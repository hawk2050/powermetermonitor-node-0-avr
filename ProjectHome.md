AVR firmware for the remote node on a wireless sensor network whose task is to monitor household power loading and use by monitoring the smart electricity meters LED flashes. Instantaneous power loading and total cummulative power use information is reported to a central controller, eventually via a cheap 433MHz wireless low bit rate data link. The plan is to have additional nodes that perform other tasks, such as environmental monitoring (e.g temperature) and active control of electrical appliances such as simple heaters by turning them on and off based on the temperature profile desired by the user, and configured at a central controller. Grand plans, now just need to time to implement them!
